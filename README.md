# Learning Course Finder Using AI All Local 

## Introduction

Have you ever wished for a smart assistant that could help you find the perfect university courses? Well, that’s exactly what I set out to create! In this article, I’ll walk you through how I built a ‘Course Finder’ using something called RAG. Don’t worry if you’re not aware — we’ll go over every detail and Build.

## What's This Project About?

This article is about how I made a special tool called a University Course Finder. It’s like a smart assistant that helps students find the right university courses. I built it using something called RAG, which stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation. It’s a clever way to search for information and give answers in normal, everyday language.

In this article, I explain how I set up the Course Finder step by step. I talk about the tools I used, like Verba and Weaviate, and why I chose them. I also share why this kind of tool is better than just using a regular AI chat system for finding course information.

## Why Use This Project?

If you’re interested in how AI can help with everyday tasks, this article is for you. It shows how we can use new technology to solve real problems, like helping students choose the right courses. You don’t need to be a tech expert to understand it — I explain everything in simple terms.

Reading this might inspire you to think about other ways AI could help in education or other areas. It’s also a good introduction to RAG technology, which is becoming more important in how we use AI to find and understand information.
